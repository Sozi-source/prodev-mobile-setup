# prodev-mobile-app-0x00

This repository contains a React Native application bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.dev).  
It documents the steps I followed during project scaffolding and my observations when resetting the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps for Scaffolding

**Initialize a new Expo project**
- npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x00

This command sets up a starter template with Expo SDK 53.

Navigate to the project folder
** cd prodev-mobile-app-0x00

### Start the development server
** npx expo start
Opens the Expo DevTools interface in the browser.

Use Expo Go on your phone (or an emulator) to preview the app.

### Observations from reset-project Command
** Running the reset-project command moves the generated code into a directory called app-example when no project name is provided.
